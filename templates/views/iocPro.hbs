  <b><h2><u>INTRODUCTION</u></h2></b><br>
  <p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;With a 33,000-plus work-force, extensive refining, distribution & marketing infrastructure and advanced R&D facilities, Indian Oil plays a significant role in fuelling the socio-economic development of the country. With a mandate to ensure India's energy security and self-sufficiency in refining & marketing of petroleum products, Indian Oil has in the past six decades provided energy access to millions of people across the length and breadth of the country through its ever-expanding network of over 50,000 customer touch-points.<br>&emsp;
With a turnover of Rs. 6,05,924 crore and a net profit of Rs. 16,894 crore in 2018-19,   Oil is recognised as one of India's most valuable companies.<br>&emsp;
The Company continues to be the largest contributor to the national exchequer in the form of duties and taxes. During the year 2018-19, Rs. 1,93,422 crore was paid to the exchequer as against Rs. 1,90,670 crore paid in the previous year.<br>&emsp;
Indian Oil's core business has been refining, transportation and marketing of petroleum products. In line with India's growing energy demand, the Company has over the years expanded its operations across the hydrocarbon value chain - upstream into oil & gas exploration & production and downstream into petrochemicals, besides diversifying into natural gas and alternative energy resources.<br>&emsp;
Indian Oil continues to expand its business operations abroad through its overseas establishments in Sri Lanka, Mauritius, UAE, Singapore, USA, Myanmar and Bangladesh.

  <p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;AR&T subsequently acquired a 77.7 square kilometre petroleum-rights concession in the Makum area of Assam, and by 1893 had drilled 10 wells at Digboi producing 757.08 litres/day. AR&T established Assam Oil Company (AOC) in 1899 with a capital of Â£310,000 to take over the petroleum interests of AR&T, including the Digboi and Makum concessions and set up a small refinery at Margharita (Upper Assam) with a capacity of 500 bopd to refine the Digboi-oil. Thereafter, systematic drilling began in 1891 and two years later in 1901, Asia's first oil refinery was set up at Digboi. It is still functional and the world's oldest operating refinery.<br>&emsp; 
Failure to utilize geologic reasoning, promiscuous wildcatting, misguided investment and nonchalance of the management towards technical support led to the compounding of errors by AOC which made the company technically and financially impotent. Later on, UK based Burma Oil Company (BOC) arrived in 1911 in Upper Assam (Surma Valley) and in 1915, after acquiring Oil interest from Budderpore Oil Co. Ltd (formed by a syndicate of Budderpore tea garden during 1911-13) began testing option in the Badarpur structure in the Surma valley (Upper Assam). Gradually by 1921, in a phase-wise manner, BOC acquired petroleum interests of AOC.<br>&emsp; 
Torsion balance which was successfully adapted for geophysical surveys of oil was used at Bordubi (Assam) by a geophysical team in 1925. The Indian Co. "TATA engineering co." has also drilled several wells in Jagatia, Gujarat and produced a small amount of gas in the 1930s. In 1937, BOC jointly with British Petroleum (then Anglo iraniann Oil Co.) and Shell proposed to Govt. of India to carry out a geophysical survey of the important plain areas of India. The proposal was accepted and a new form of grant known as the geophysical license was issued by Assam Government. In Assam, a successful seismic survey was carried out in Naharkatia during 1937-39, triggering new enthusiasm in oil search and it became a forerunner of discoveries in Assam basins and others also. The successful outcome of well NHK-1 in 1937 was vindication for a geophysical method in oil exploration.<br>&emsp;
The world knew the importance of oil and after Independence, Indian leaders realized its utility for rapid industrialization and security of the nation. The company rule which was earlier framed to satiate the raw material need of the British Empire was re-framed. While framing industrial policy 1948, the development of the petroleum industry in the country was given top priority.<br>&emsp; 
By 1948, GSI has started geophysical survey in Cambay area. The first oil discovery in independent India was made by AOC on 1953 in Nahorkatia and then in Moran in 1956 both in Upper Assam.  The oil industry, after independence, remained operated by a foreign company for a considerable period. Burma Oil Company (BOC) kept its position as the largest company in India till the end of its operation.<br>&emsp; 
ONGC systematically started its geophysical surveys on areas considered prospective on the basis of global analogy. Further, the thrust was given for survey in the area of Himalayan foothills and adjoining Ganga plains, alluvial tracts of Gujarat, upper Assam and basins of Bengal. The exploratory drilling carried out in Himalayan foothill during 1957, remained unsuccessful. Within a year of being formed, ONGC discovered oil at Cambay. The giant Ankleshwar field in the state of Gujarat in 1960, Kalol in 1961, Lakwa in 1964, Geleki in 1968 and Gas discovery-Manhar tibba in Rajasthan in 1969 were discovered subsequently.<br>&emsp;
The company was owned by 2/3rd by AOC/BOC and 1/3rd by Government of India and in 1961 they became equal partners by transforming OIL into a JV company. OIL discovered Kusijan oilfield in 1969 and Jorajan oilfield in 1972. Later, Eocene gas was discovered by OIL in Tengakhat field of Assam in 1973.<br>&emsp; 
Offshore exploration was initiated by ONGC in the form of an experimental seismic survey in 1962 in Gulf of Cambay and later in western offshore. Detailed seismic surveys in western offshore resulted in a discovery of large structure on Bombay-offshore in 1972-73 and drilling lead to India's biggest commercial discovery - Bombay High. Encouraged by this discovery, exploration was furthered in entire western off-shore including Kerala-Konkan basin and eastern offshore area. This led to large discovery of Bassein and Neelam in western offshore and PY-3 & Ravva in Eastern offshore. OIL also ventured from Assam to Orissa both in onshore and offshore. During 1979-89 it went to Andaman offshore and Rajasthan onshore. By the end of the 80s, ONGC and OIL has together drilled nearly 3100 wells totalling 4.9 million metres.<br>&emsp;
Till the end of the 1970s, Indian E&P industry was dominated by the two National Oil Companies (NOCs) - ONGC and OIL to whom PELs were granted on nomination basis. Exploration was primarily confined to on land and shallow offshore. The strategic initiative was taken by the government in 1979 to attract foreign investment, technology and capital to deal with future commitment and challenges of Indian oil economy by offering 32 exploration blocks (17 offshore & 15 onshore). The government started offering block systematically through bidding. These rounds are also known as Pre-NELP Exploration rounds. The three rounds during 1980-1986 were not very successful.<br>&emsp;
 By 1981 Government took over OIL and it became full-fledged PSU. In 1982, ONGC made its biggest gas discovery in Gandhar, Cambay basin of Gujarat and by 1986 KG basin were put in global map with several substantial discoveries made. By the end of 1986, 3rd round of international bidding for exploration blocks were offered. OIL and ONGC were offered 40% stake in JV if the field was found viable. Few foreign companies participated but there was no committed exploration or breakthrough discovery. The foreshore terminal of IOC was commissioned in Madras (Chennai). However OIL and ONGC's effort continued in several parts of India and by 1989 OIL discovered gas in Tanot (Mata Temple) in Rajasthan and ONGC discovered south Heera in Mumbai offshore.<br>&emsp; 
In 1991, the Government of India (GoI) adopted liberalized economic policy that led to de-licensing of the core group including the petroleum sector and partial dis-investment of government share including other measures. As a result, ONGC was re-organized as a Limited company from Oil and Natural Gas Commission to Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited. To give momentum to the Petroleum sector in India, GoI came up with more lucrative offers in 1994.<br>&emsp; 
The government efforts, particularly during 1991-1996, gave required thrust for opening up the Indian Oil and Gas sector in India. After this, the process of opening the sector became more streamlined. Many private players also joined in the development of this industry. Hindustan Oil Exploration Company (HOEC) which started its E & P venture in 1991, was among the few such initial domestic private players.<br>&emsp;
In view of the liberalized policy adopted by GoI, a need for an independent upstream regulatory body called the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) was envisaged to oversee and review the oilfield development programs so as to conform to sound reservoir engineering practices in line with national interests. Thus, DGH was formed vide GoI resolution dated 08.04.1993.<br>&emsp; 
After the Nomination era till the late 1970s, Pre-NELP Exploration era (1980-95) and Pre-NELP Field rounds (1993-94), Government of India formulated a policy called New Exploration Licensing Policy in 1997.  The main objective was to attract significant risk capital from Indian and Foreign companies, state of the art  technologies,  new geological concepts and best management practices to explore oil and gas resources in the country to meet rising demands of oil and gas.	This policy NELP was approved in 1997 and it became effective in February, 1999. Since then licenses for exploration are being awarded only system and  National  Oil  Companies (NOCs)  are  required  to  compete  on  an  equal  footing  with  Indian  and  foreign  companies  to secure Petroleum Exploration Licenses (PELs). Nine rounds of bids have so far been concluded under NELP, in which production sharing contracts for 254 exploration blocks have been signed.</p><br>

  <p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;With the olefins cycle likely to decline further, domestic petrochemical producers are expected to face tough times going forward which in turn is bound to lead to subdued returns. As per an ICRANSE -0.46 % note on the industry, most Indian petrochemical players have enjoyed robust cash earnings over the past several years and their net debt levels have been relatively low.<br>&emsp; 
Notwithstanding the backlash, improving living standards, population growth, increasing urbanization and lack of cost-effective alternatives would continue to support the growth of many plastics over the next decade.<br>&emsp; 
In 2018, The company approves buyback worth Rs 4,435 crore (US$ 634.57 million) Remains the country's most profitable state-run company for the second year in a row Indian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, plans to invest 2 trillion rupees ($27.98 billion) in five-seven years to meet energy needs of diverse user groups, Chairman Sanjiv Singh told a shareholders meeting.<br>&emsp; 
IOC through its 11 refineries controls about a third of India's 5 million-barrel-per-day (bpd) refining capacity. Singh said the investment was required to help IOC "evolve into a future-ready corporate that provides comprehensive energy solutions to diverse user groups".The company is investing over 200 billion rupees by 2023-24 to expand its petrochemicals capacity and another 100 billion rupees in eight years for expansion of city gas distribution projects in the country.<br>&emsp; 
India has nudged Russia to use its influence on oil suppliers cartel OPEC to balance the global oil market, ensuring adequate supply with responsible and reasonable price. New Delhi and Moscow have agreed to launch a sea route that will extend from Vladivostok, a major port city in Eastern Russia, to Chennai, on the Bay of Bengal in eastern India. The agreement, made under a âmemorandum of understandingâ signed by both countries, could present a challenge to China as the maritime route will include parts of the South China Sea where Beijing continues to flex its muscle and ignore international rulings that deny its claims over a large part of the sea. The joint statement by Russia and India indicated that the partnership could âinclude establishing joint development and production of military equipment, spare parts and components as well as improving the system of after-sales services.â And it comes about a year after New Delhi agreed to purchase Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. India also agreed to a loan worth $1 billion for Russia to develop its far east region for resources, presumably oil, gas and minerals. India, with a population of over 1.3 billion, is seeing increased trade with East Asia.<br>&emsp; 
Indian Oil, the state-owned oil company of India, has peered into the future, determined that the future of transportation is electric, and wants in on the transition, but in a way that is compatible with the needs of the country. India has no lithium deposits that could be used to manufacture conventional lithium-ion battery
