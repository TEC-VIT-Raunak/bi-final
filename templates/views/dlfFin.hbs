<p>The company was founded by Chaudhary Raghuvendra Singh. The company developed some of the first residential colonies in Delhi such as Krishna Nagar in East Delhi which was completed in 1949. Following the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957 the state assumed control of real estate development activities in Delhi which resulted in restrictions on private real estate colony development. They therefore commenced acquiring land at relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, particularly in the district of Gurgaon in the adjacent state of Haryana.This led to their first landmark real estate development project DLF Qutab Enclave which has now evolved into DLF City.
